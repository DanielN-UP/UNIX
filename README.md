# UNIX LEGACY SYSTEM

The system implemented was based on the UNIX legacy system. Instead of utilizing a command-line interface, the system implements the components that the command-line interface would in a GUI application for easier traceability and understandability. The UNIX system is a server system that allows various users to access resources and use the system simultaneously. 

The components that are implemented include: 
1. A profile sign-up form which users will use to make a new profile within the system that uses authentication protocols to verify if a user already exists or not. 
2. A profile login form that users will use to access their system that uses authentication protocols to verify credentials entered by a user.
3. A dashboard for file management where users can search for files within the database and retrieve those files and also return edits done on the files.
4. An admin section where admins will be able to create new files, view files used by different users, and delete files, for users within the database.
5. An admin section where admins are able to view users within the system, and delete users from the database.
